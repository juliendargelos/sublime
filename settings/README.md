# Sublime
*<p align="right"><sub>Requires OS X and ruby</sub></p>*

- [Install Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com) (or a [dev build](https://www.sublimetext.com/3dev) which could be better)
- Clone the repository: `git clone git@github.com:juliendargelos/sublime.git`
- Go to the repository folder: `cd sublime`
- Run the installation script depending on these conditions:
	- **Your Sublime Text application support folder is located at `/Users/[yourname]/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 3/`:**

		Just type `./install`
	- **Your Sublime Text application support folder is elsewhere or the first method did not work:**

		Type `./install "/path/to/your/sublime/text/application/folder"`
-  Enjoy ðŸ˜‰
